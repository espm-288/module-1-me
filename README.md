# 🏴‍☠️ ESPM 288 - Module 1: Wranglin' Tabular Data Bigger Than Yer Ship's Hold! ⚓🦜

## 🗺️ Ahoy, Matey! What Be This Treasure Map About?

Avast ye! This here module be teachin' ye the fine art o' handlin' datasets so massive they'd sink yer RAM faster than a cannonball through a dinghy! 💥 Usin' the finest tools in all the seven seas like `duckdbfs` and DuckDB, ye'll learn to query and plunder large-scale tabular data without loadin' the whole treasure chest into memory, savvy? 🦜




## 🎯 What Ye'll Be Learnin' on This Voyage

- ⛵ Connect to remote cloud-based treasure troves (AWS S3) without downloadin' 'em to yer ship!
- 🦆 Use lazy evaluation with `duckdbfs::open_dataset()` fer efficient data access (work smarter, not harder, ye scallywag!)
- ⚔️ Apply `dplyr` verbs that translate to optimized SQL queries faster than a kraken can grab ye
- 🏝️ Filter and query massive datasets before collectin' results into memory
- 🌍 Work with the legendary EXIOBASE 3.8.1 global Multi-Regional Input-Output database (the X marks the spot!)

## 🗺️ The Treasure Hunt: Case Study

This module uses **EXIOBASE 3.8.1**, a legendary treasure map trackin':
- 💰 Economic transactions across 44 countries from 1995 to 2022 (that be a lot o' doubloons!)
- 🌊 Environmental impacts includin' carbon emissions, water usage, and land use (we be responsible pirates, arr!)
- 🚢 Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) relationships between industries and regions (how the gold flows between ports!)

The dataset be hosted on Source Cooperative and accessed directly from S3 storage, demonstratin' modern cloud-native data workflows. No need to load the whole treasure onto yer vessel! ☁️⚓

## 🛠️ Yer Pirate Tools

- **duckdbfs** 🦆: High-performance interface fer workin' with remote datasets (fast as a duck on water!)
- **DuckDB** 🦆💨: Fastest analytical database engine in the Caribbean, optimized fer OLAP queries
- **dplyr** 📊: Data manipulation with lazy evaluation (don't do the work till ye have to!)
- **Quarto** 📜: Reproducible document generation (keep a proper ship's log!)

## ⚓ Hoist the Anchor & Set Sail!

Open [tabular-data.qmd](tabular-data.qmd) to begin yer adventure through these exercises, ye landlubber! 🏴‍☠️💎

Fair winds and followin' seas! 🌊⛵
